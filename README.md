# CreditCardFraud
Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. By analyzing transaction data, the model identifies patterns and anomalies that indicate potential fraud, helping financial institutions reduce losses and enhance security.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Handled class imbalance, missing values, and outliers.
Feature Engineering: Performed feature scaling and selection to improve model performance.
Dataset
The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle and contains 284,807 transactions, with only 0.17% labeled as fraudulent.

Key Insights
Fraudulent transactions were significantly imbalanced in the dataset.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning to address real-world fraud detection challenges, emphasizing the importance of data preprocessing and model selection in achieving high accuracy and reliability.
